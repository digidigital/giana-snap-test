  Evil Swampy and his followers have stolen the magic ruby, which made it once possible for Giana and Maria to return from their dream.
  Many creatures are after this ruby, but does it really has power, or was it just a coincidence? As this is not bad enough, Swampy fell
  in love at first sight with Giana’s sister Maria and shamelessly kidnapped her. She simply has been at the wrong place at the wrong
  time.You will now have to take on the role of Giana and get back the magic ruby. And most important of all, save your beloved sister 
  Maria and get home save! Good Luck!
